### UI
- [x] good looking ui
- [ ] prettify reset button
- [ ] don't show ui until we connect to socket server! otherwise things break down real fast (!!!!)
- [ ] include intro message if the log is empty
- [ ] optimize for mobile
- [ ] ice server optimization/better init stuff <-- figure out what's going on

### Backend
- [ ] disconnect from socket server when necessary!
- [ ] check for new clients/messages in background!!! (through webworker <-- socket server only)
- [ ] make peerlist sending more reliable/not dpeendnet on send
