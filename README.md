#P2P Chat

##UI
[ ] prettify reset button
[ ] don't show ui until we connect to socket server! otherwise things break down real fast (!!!!)
[ ] include intro message if the log is empty
[ ] optimize for mobile

##Backend
[ ] disconnect from socket server when necessary!
[ ] check for new clients/messages in background!!! (through webworker <-- socket server only)
