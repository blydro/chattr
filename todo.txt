- css/ui
- don't show ui until we connect to socket server! otherwise things break down real fast

- refactor setupPeers --> either have it have its own functions or just make it cleaner and more consistent!
- componentize a little bit
  - socket should be in props!
  - logitems container!

- dont' allow for setting an empty name
- put every new peer in the name object as itself?
- use namecheck function in more places!
