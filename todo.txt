- show peers online! (and add relevant logic)
- css

- refactor setupPeers --> either have it have its own functions or just make it cleaner and more consistent!
- componentize a little bit
  - socket should be in props
  - logitems container?

- save stuff in localstorage!
- dont' allow for setting an empty name
- make name check/peerid parse a function? or even better put every new peer in the name object as itself?
